#Spotify Trackmerge

With this tool, you'll be able to log into your Spotify account and merge selected Playlists together.
Either you select them manually, or the tracks will be selected by Genre. 
Yay, finally you have all your favorite tracks of a certain Genre together in one Playlist.

Afterwards the Playlist will be exported to a .json format, to get all the tracks into Beatport.
